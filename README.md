### Overview
Next week we'll learn how to use scikit-learn to run linear regression models, how goals & business objectives translate to model fit, and how to optimize models using cross-validation. We're going to use these skills to dig into a rich set of data on this project!

The state of Iowa provides many datasets on their website, including [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5oiz27mhvsiibo8/iowa_liquor_sales_proj_2.csv?dl=0) which contains transactions for all stores that have a class E liquor license.

NOTE: The dataset may be too big for you to analyze. In this case, feel free to use [this 10% dataset version of Iowa liquor sales](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx2SHQGVqWaseDB4QU9ZSVFDY2M/view?usp=sharing). You may want to use it anyway to test your code since it will be faster.

**Please save these .csv files on your local computer.** Do **NOT** put them in your GitHub repo. The size of the files can cause github to crash if you attempt to push them to the remote repo.

**You can choose one of the following two scenarios.**

### Scenario 1: State tax board

You are a data scientist in residence at the Iowa State tax board. The Iowa State legislature is considering changes in the liquor tax rates and wants a report of current liquor sales by county and projections for the rest of the year to inform their decision.

**Goal for Scenario #1:** Your task is as follows:

* Calculate the yearly liquor sales for each store using the provided data. You can add up the transactions for each year, and store sales in 2015 specifically will be used later as your target variable.
* Use the data from 2015 to make a linear model using as many variables as you find useful to predict the yearly sales of all stores. You must use the sales from January to March as one of your variables.
* Use your model for 2015 to estimate total sales in 2016, extrapolating from the sales so far for January to March of 2016.
* Report your findings, including any projected increase or decrease in total sales (over the entire state) for the tax committee of the Iowa legislature.
* Use cross-validation to check how your model predicts to held out data compared to the model metrics on the full dataset.
* Fit your model(s) using one or both of the regularization tactics covered. Explain whether the regularized or the non-regularized model performed better and what the selected regression(s) are doing.


### Scenario 2: Market research for new store locations

A liquor store owner in Iowa is looking to expand to new locations and has hired you to investigate the market data for potential new locations. The business owner is interested in the details of the best model you can fit to the data so that her team can evaluate potential locations for a new storefront.

**Goal for Scenario #2:** Your task is to:

* Build models of total sales based on location, price per bottle, total bottles sold. You may find it useful to build models for each county, ZIP code, or city.
* Provide a table of the best performing stores by location type of your choice (city, county, or ZIP code) and the predictions of your model(s).
* Based on your models and the table of data, recommend at least three locations to the business owner, taking into account model performance. Validate your model's performance and ability to predict future sales using cross-validation. Compare and contrast these locations.
* _Hint_: Rather than just identifying locations where its stores perform well, it would be good to try and identify locations that are undersaturated. You may want additional data to help answer this problem.
* _Bonus_: Recommend targets for volume sold and price per bottle!

###  Requirements

Using a provided dataset, create a model and an executive summary write-up based on your chosen scenario.

Create a stakeholder presentation that covers your methodologies, process, findings, conclusion and recommendations.

Your work must:

**Identify the problem**
- Write a high quality problem statement.
- Describe the goals of your study and criteria for success.

**Acquire the data**
- Obtain the data [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5oiz27mhvsiibo8/iowa_liquor_sales_proj_2.csv?dl=0) -- it's from [Iowa.gov](Iowa.gov), filtered and reduced a bit.
- There is a further reduced version that is 10% of the version above [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx2SHQGVqWaseDB4QU9ZSVFDY2M/view?usp=sharing).

**Explore the data**
- Import data using the Pandas Library.
- Perform exploratory analysis with visualizations and statistical analysis.
- State the risks and assumptions of your data.

**Mine the data**
- Create necessary derived columns from the data.
- Format, clean, slice, and combine the data in Python.

**Refine the data**
- Determine outliers, skew distribution of important variables (if any).
- Determine correlations / causations in the data.
- Validate findings using statistical analysis (p-values, confidence intervals) as applicable.

**Build a data model**
- Complete linear regressions using scikit-learn or statsmodels and interpret your findings.
- Calculate and plot predicted probabilities and/or present tables of results.
- Describe the bias-variance tradeoff of your model and errors metrics.
- Evaluate model fit by using loss functions, including mean absolute error, mean squared error, and/or $R^2$.

**Present the results**
- Create a Jupyter Notebook hosted on GitHub Enterprise that provides a dataset overview with visualizations, statistical analysis, data cleaning methodologies, and models.
- Create a write-up on the interpretation of findings including an executive summary with conclusions and next steps.

***Bonus!:***
- Identify and discuss outliers.
- Use regularization.
- Brainstorm ways to improve your analysis; for example:
 - Add additional breakdowns and models, e.g. by month.
 - Recommend (or use!) additional data that might improve your models
- Create a blog post of at least 500 words (and 1-2 graphics!) describing your data, analysis, and approach. Link to it in your Jupyter Notebook.
 - **Pro Tip:** Try converting your Jupyter Notebook to HTML to create an easy blog post draft!

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Materials must be in a clearly commented Jupyter Notebook that satisfies project requirements.
- You must submit a set of .pdf slides associated with your presentation.
- You must, at minimum, have a link to your slides and a link to your Jupyter notebook on your personal static site.
- Materials must be submitted by Monday, October 23 at 9:00:00 a.m. EST. You will submit a link to your slides, your link to your Jupyter notebook, and your link to your static site via Google form. If your slides are not hosted online, you may Slack your slides to a DSIR.

### Starter code

The starter code has a loose outline for you to follow to explore the data and build your models. Make sure to consider strategies for your specific scenario.

### Dataset

The dataset transactions for all stores that have a class E liquor license in the state of Iowa. It has been significantly reduced from the original file but you'll need to reduce and clean it further.

The dataset contains the same information as the data above, but just 10% of the original sample.

Students interested in viewing the original, unreduced file can compare the reduced Project version with the [original full version, found here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5oiz27mhvsiibo8/iowa_liquor_sales_proj_2.csv?dl=0). In fact, Iowa provides over 2GB of data stretching further back in time! This can be a useful tool to help understand the need to frame and filter data.

**We expect your final work to be done with the 100% dataset!**

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

**Tips for both scenarios:**

1. Likely you will find it useful to reduce the data set with pandas before fitting models. You may want to make a new table with the following data for each store:
 * The vendor name
 * The location data (ZIP code, county, city)
 * The total sales for the year
 * The total sales for each month (or at least for Jan-March for the first scenario)
 * The total volume sold
 * The total number of bottles sold
 * The average price per bottle (perhaps useful for distinguishing store types)

2. We're using linear regression for our models. Find the best model you can, but don't fret if you cannot get a really good model. We'll learn techniques later that will help improve your analysis, such as _classifying store types_. For now, do the best you can with the tools that you have.

3. Take advantage of Pandas as much as possible -- the `groupby`, `summation`, and other features of DataFrames can make computing the necessary summary data much easier. This is a great time to practice what you learned in Week 2!

4. Take care in the presentation of your results. Your audience non-technical, so explain your findings in accessible language.

**General suggestions:**
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.  
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success!
- Document **everything**.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your instructors will score you using the scale below:

|      **Score**     |     **Expectations**     |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  **0** | Fail. At least one project criterion was not met or some flagrant issue occurred. |
| **1** | Pass. Project criteria were minimally met. Non-trivial changes would be needed to make this work-ready.    |
| **2** | Pass. Project criteria were met. This presentation needs, at most, trivial changes to be work-ready. |
| **3** | Pass. This presentation is excellent, exceeds requirements in a substantial way, and is a model for the rest of the class. |

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals!
